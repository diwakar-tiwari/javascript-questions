var x = 10;

function foo() {
  console.log(x);
  var x = 20;
}

foo();
Output: undefined
Explanation: JavaScript has function-level scoping, which means that variable declarations are hoisted to the top of their containing function. 
In the `foo` function, the variable `x` is hoisted, but its value is not assigned until the line `var x = 20`.
Therefore, when `console.log(x)` is executed, the variable `x` exists but has no assigned value, resulting in `undefined`.
